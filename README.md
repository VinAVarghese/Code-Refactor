# HW01-Code-Refactor

This code-refactor assignment involved adding semantic html elements instead of using generic div tags etc., as well as, structuring the html elements logically and sequentially. It also involved adding alt attributes to img elements for accessibility, along with updating the title element for a more concise, meaningful description of the site.
